  By default, IntelliJ interprets *.properties files as being encoded using ISO 8859-1. This is an issue because
  strings_en.properties, etc. use characters with different encodings in UTF-8 and ISO 8859-1 (characters with accents,
  emoji, etc.). If you use IntelliJ to add one of these characters to a properties file, it may cause Java to treat the
  entire file as if itâ€™s ISO 8859-1. This can lead to weird test errors (e.g. org.junit.ComparisonFailure).
